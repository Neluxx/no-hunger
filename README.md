# No Hunger - Vanilla Food

The No Hunger datapack restores the old-school Minecraft food mechanic: no hunger bar, no saturation, no hidden stats. Food directly heals your health, just like in the early days of the game. This datapack replaces the modern hunger system for a simpler, more nostalgic experience.

## Features

- Completely disables the hunger bar 
- Food restores health directly:
  - Each food item has a unique healing value
  - No saturation, no regeneration over time
- Compatible with all vanilla food items 
- Server-friendly and multiplayer compatible 
- Minimal and clean: no changes to loot tables or core mechanics
